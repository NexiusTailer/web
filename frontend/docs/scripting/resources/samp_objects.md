### **SF ZomboTech Building and Lab**

These objects can be used to replace the ZomboTech building in SF. The
filterscript called "sf_zombotech" can be used to remove the existing GTASA map
objects, replace the building, add the new lab building below the ground and add
an elevator... it can be found in the "filterscripts" folder of the Windows
0.3.7 server package.

```

### **LS Apartments**

This object can be used to replace a block of apartments in LS. The filterscript
called "ls_apartments1" can be used to remove the existing GTASA map objects,
replace the building, add an underground car park and elevator... it can be
found in the "filterscripts" folder of the Windows 0.3.7 server package.

```
19595	LSAppartments1
```

### **LS BeachSide**

These objects are used to replace a block of apartments on the beach in LS. The
apartment building now has a multiple floor interior and an underground car
park. The filterscript called "ls_beachside" can be used to add an elevator...
it can be found in the "filterscripts" folder of the Windows 0.3.7 server
package.

Also, object ID 19596 has been moved to model ID 6391 to replace the existing
GTASA building. The interior floors object (19597) and underground car park
object (19800) are also created by default from lines defined in the SAMP.IPL
file. This means you do not need to create these objects (building exterior,
interior floors and underground car park) as they are created by default on all
0.3.7 clients. You do however need to remove the night lights object as
demonstrated in the filterscript to remove some occlusion boxes inside the
building that cause camera problems.

```

```

### **SF Building 1**

These objects can be used to replace a building near the hospital in SF. The

folder of the Windows 0.3.7 server package.

### **Half Tube Objects**

The MatTubes TXD file contains different coloured textures (RedDirt1,
GreenDirt1, BlueDirt1, YellowDirt1 and PurpleDirt1) that can be used to
re-colour the tubes below by using the SetObjectMaterial() or
SetPlayerObjectMaterial() functions. Re-colouring the tubes this way preserves
the shading (the vertex colours and vertex illumination).

The tubes are available in three sizes... normal (100%), medium (50%) and small
(25%).

The filterscript called "stunt_island" shows an example setup... it can be found
in the "filterscripts" folder of the Windows 0.3.7 server package.

The tubes in this section are normal size.
