## คำอธิบาย

Create a static 'actor' in the world. These 'actors' are like NPCs, however they have limited functionality. They do not take up server player slots.

| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| modelid  | The model ID (skin ID) the actor should have.      |
| x        | The X coordinate to create the actor at.           |
| y        | The Y coordinate to create the actor at.           |
| z        | The Z coordinate to create the actor at.           |

new ActorCJ;

public OnGameModeInit()
{
    // Create an actor (CJ) at Blueberry Acres (Center of SA map)
    ActorCJ = CreateActor(0, 0.0, 0.0, 3.0, 0.0);
}
```

## บันทึก

:::tip

Actors are designed to just stand somewhere, for example cashiers and bartenders. They can perform animations (once or looping) using ApplyActorAnimation.

:::

:::warning

Actors are completely separate from NPCs. They do NOT use player IDs/slots on the server and CANNOT be handled like NPCs. Actors are limited to 1000 (MAX_ACTORS). Actors can be pushed by vehicles, use a timer to put them back at their positions. As of 0.3.7 R2 actors default to being invulnerable.
